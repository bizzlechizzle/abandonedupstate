LaFayette Hills Golf & Country Club, nestled in Jamesville, New York, was a semi-private golf course established in 1923. It featured an 18-hole layout designed by Seymour Dunn, covering a span of 6550 yards with a par of 71. Despite its historical charm and available amenities like a driving range and clubhouse facilities, the club faced a sharp decline in membership, culminating in its closure. The club’s last known operations suggest dwindling support and financial instability, which was exacerbated by a tax dispute with the city of Syracuse and a significant drop in membership from 350 to zero by 2013
