The Wiscoy School, also known as District #9, is a two room schoolhouse in Wiscoy, Caneadea, Allegany County, New York, built in 1880. It was last sold for $1,400 in 2020. Former student Gary Nevinger recalls his time there, and there's a shared desire among residents to restore it and transform it into a museum, but it currently serves as storage and is deteriorating.
