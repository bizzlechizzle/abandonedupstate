The Dog House is an abandoned residence nestled within a barn near the Pennsylvania border in Owego, New York. The property's history traces back to 1870, with the barn itself constructed in 1948, likely replacing the original structure. The conversion into a makeshift half-residence and half-barn likely occurred in the early 1970s.

The circumstances surrounding how a Cornell graduate came to reside in this unconventional dwelling remain shrouded in mystery. Remarkably, she remains active on social media and has garnered recognition as a judge in various dog competitions. The Cornell graduate vacated the premises in 1990, only a handful months after the included aerial photograph was taken, leaving no doubt that she was living here, if not indoors in the historic photo.
