The Cadillac House is an abandoned residence situated in the Finger Lakes Region of Upstate New York. Constructed in 1840, the house follows the Farmhouse Greek Revival Style. The name "The Cadillac House" stems from the presence of a forgotten Cadillac Eldorado found in the garage. The property owner resides out of state and has a history of unpaid back taxes dating back to the 1980s. Evidently, this house, likely the owner's childhood home, has remained vacant since their parents passed away.
