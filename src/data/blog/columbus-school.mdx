Columbus School is an abandoned elementary school situated on the east side of Rome, New York. Established in 1923, it was named Columbus School following written requests from students in November of the same year. Operating for several decades, the school remained open until the late 1990s and continued to serve various purposes for the local community, including functioning as an interim place station into the early 2000s. Despite its closure, Columbus School has been bought and relisted for sale multiple times, yet it remains unrepurposed.
