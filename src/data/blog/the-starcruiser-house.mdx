The Starcruiser House is an abandoned rural residence situated in southern Tioga County, New York. Constructed in 1870, it follows the vernacular farmhouse architectural style. While not historically significant, what adds intrigue to this property is the presence of an abandoned Starcraft Starcruiser motor home. An aerial photograph from 1989 capture the RV parked alongside the house, adding a distinctive and intriguing element to its story.
