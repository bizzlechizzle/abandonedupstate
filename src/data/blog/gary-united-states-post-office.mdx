The Gary United States Post Office anchors a prominent corner in downtown Gary, Indiana. Designed by architect Howard Lovewell Cheney in the Art Moderne style, the facility opened in 1936 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal public works program. With its mechanized sorting equipment and proximity to an active rail spur, the post office served as a regional hub for northwestern Indiana mail. As U.S. Steel’s fortunes declined and the city’s population plummeted, operations dwindled until the building was shuttered in the fall of 1974.
