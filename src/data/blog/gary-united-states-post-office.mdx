Gary United States Post Office - 2009

The Gary United States Post Office is located in the heart of Gary, Indiana.  This Art Moderne style building designed by Howard Lovewell Cheney was built in 1936 as part of FDR's New Deal.  Due to its machine based sorting capabilities, this facility processed mail for a significant portion of Northwestern Indiana. The rapid decline in the U.S. Steel industry would hit Gary hard, leading to this buildings abandonment in the fall of 1974.
