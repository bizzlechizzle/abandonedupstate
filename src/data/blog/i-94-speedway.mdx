The I-94 Speedway, also known as the I-94 Raceway, is a prominent race track situated in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. Established in 1991 as a dirt track, it earned the distinction of being Minnesota's first to transition to an asphalt surface.

The I-94 Raceway played host to an array of prestigious racing events, including NASCAR Midwest series races, ASA Midwest Tour races, and an ARTGO race. After changing owners in the spring of 2009, it reverted to its original Speedway name and a clay surface. Less than six months later, the I-94 Speedway held its final race.
