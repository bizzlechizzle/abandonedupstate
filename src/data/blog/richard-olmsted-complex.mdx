The Richardson Olmsted Complex, also known as the Buffalo State Asylum for the Insane, is an abandoned kirkbride hospital in Buffalo, New York. Erected in 1872, the building showcases an ominous architectural style now recognized as "Richardsonian Romanesque." The psychiatric facility ceased operations under state management in 1974, remaining shuttered for decades.

In 2017, the complex underwent a partial restoration and was repurposed into a unique and historic hotel. This transformation breathed new life into the Richardson Olmsted Complex, allowing it to take on a different role while preserving its historic and architectural significance.
