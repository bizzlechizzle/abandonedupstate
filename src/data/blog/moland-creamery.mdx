Moland Co-op Creamery Association - Spring 2015

Moland Creamery, situated on the Rice-Steele County border in Central Minnesota, was established in 1896. Renowned for its top-quality butter, it consistently won awards at local county fairs and the state fair. After serving the community for two decades, a fire razed it on July 7th, 1920.

Remarkably, the creamery was rebuilt in under 90 days. The new structure boasted an upstairs auditorium that hosted local elections and events, in addition to accommodations for the butter makers. It continued to be a cornerstone of the area until its closure in 1967.
