The Charlotte Kenyon Elementary School, also known as Chenango Forks Central School, has a history dating back to 1929 when it was built during the Great Depression. Over the years, it expanded to accommodate the growing student population. In 1978, it was renamed Charlotte Kenyon Elementary in honor of a dedicated teacher who served for more than 40 years. However, in 2002, the school was vacated, and despite plans for revitalization, it remains vacant to this day.
