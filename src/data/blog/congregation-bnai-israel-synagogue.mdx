The Congregation B’Nai Israel (Congregation Ahavas Achim Anshi Austria) synagogue, located at 692 Joseph Avenue in Rochester, New York, is a significant historical and cultural landmark. Established in 1928, it has been a central part of the Jewish community, serving as a hub for religious and social activities. The synagogue is one of the oldest existing structures from the 20th century in the area. Recently, there have been plans to renovate the building into a performing arts center, which is part of a broader initiative to revitalize the Joseph Avenue area. This transformation aims to breathe new life into the historic structure while preserving its cultural heritage.
