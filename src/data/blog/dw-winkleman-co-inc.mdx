D.W. Winkelman Co. Inc is an abandoned warehouse located on the East Side of Syracuse, NY. Owned and operated by Dwight W. Winkelman, the company originated in Chicago in 1924. Relocating to New York in 1930 for projects in the Adirondacks, Winkelman settled in Syracuse and established an office in 1937.

Specializing in heavy construction, the company undertook projects ranging from airports and highways to buildings and military bases. In 1988, the site was designated as an inactive hazardous waste site due to the leakage of PCB-laden oil from three broken and vandalized transformers on the property, marking a significant event in the history of D.W. Winkelman Co. Inc.
