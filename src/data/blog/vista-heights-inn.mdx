Vista Heights Inn is an abandoned motel situated in Henrietta, New York. Built in 1956, the motel boasts a semi-unique detached layout. During the 1960s and 1970s, it operated as the Highlander Motor Hotel. In its most recent years, the motel functioned under both the names Vista Heights Inn and the Red Roof Brand. While the exact closing date remains unknown, online reviews show a decline after 2016, with a noteworthy absence of positive reviews beyond 2010.
