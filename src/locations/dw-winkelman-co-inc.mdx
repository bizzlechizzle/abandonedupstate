D.W. Winkelman Co. Inc. is an abandoned warehouse complex on the east side of Syracuse, New York. Owned and operated by Dwight W. Winkelman, the company originated in Chicago in 1924 before relocating to New York in 1930 for Adirondack construction projects. Winkelman established the Syracuse office in 1937 to oversee heavy civil work across the region.

Specializing in large-scale infrastructure, the company built airports, highways, military bases, and industrial facilities. By 1988 the site was listed as an inactive hazardous waste area after vandals ruptured transformers and released PCB-laden oil onto the propertyâ€”an event that marked the start of decades-long abandonment and tax delinquency for the parcel.
