The Coliseum stands as an abandoned roller rink in Ceres, New York. Initially constructed in 1902, this brick structure served as a natural gas steam powerhouse to fuel the Olean - Bradford trolley line. In 1928, the building underwent a transformation, shedding its industrial past to become "The Coliseum at Ceres, Allegany County's newest and finest ballroom." Over the years, the structure hosted various businesses and venues before eventually settling into its role as the roller rink known today as "The Coliseum." However, the business met an unfortunate end in June 2005 when a tractor-trailer veered off the road, colliding with the north side brick wall and erupting into flames.
