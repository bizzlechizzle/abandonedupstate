# Abandoned Upstate

A custom Astro-powered archive documenting abandoned and historic locations throughout upstate New York and the surrounding region. The site features long-form writeups, photo galleries, and research notes that capture both current conditions and historical context for every location.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) for static site generation
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) for fast static search
- Markdown/MDX content stored under `src/data/blog`

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the local dev server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:4321/` by default. Hot reloading is enabled for content and style changes.

### Useful Scripts

| Command             | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm run dev`      | Start the local development server         |
| `pnpm run build`    | Create a production build in `./dist`      |
| `pnpm run preview`  | Preview the production build locally       |
| `pnpm run lint`     | Run ESLint against the project             |

## Content & Media

- Location writeups live in `src/data/blog/*.mdx`.
- Images are organized per location inside `src/assets/images/`.
- Frontmatter supports fields like `featured`, `featuredCaption`, `tags`, and `ogImage` for tailored presentation and OG metadata.
